# HR ETL Pipeline Project

This repository contains the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process for the HR database project, and its purpose is to build a normalized relational database that supports workforce analysis and employee attrition insights for NYTech.co, a fictional company facing employee attrition issues.

## Project Overview

Our team designed a PostgreSQL-based HR database in full compliance with the 3rd Normal Form (3NF). This system allows the company to efficiently store, query, and visualize human resource data, including:

- Demographics
- Education and job roles
- Salary components and compensation
- Work experience and engagement metrics
- Attrition and performance indicators

We used Python for the ETL pipeline and loaded the cleaned data into **PostgreSQL (pgAdmin4)**. The final database supports structured analysis through **SQL queries** and **Metabase dashboards**.
